# Flux
## How to make your own server:<br>
Go to the repo at https://github.com/sauc23/Vercel-Bare-Server <br>
from there fork it and deploy it <br>
then go  to the site, it should look like this: <br>
<img src="readme-assets/bare.png" alt="should look like this"> <br>
then go into the flux/uv/uv.config.js of your fork of flux (yea if you want your own flux link you will have to fork it)<br>
and change the line i have pointed out in there to your new bare server URL<br>


### If you have questions, feel free to put them in the issues of this repo!<br>
#### If this does not work, I will be making a second version of flux that uses wisp, which is better
